# Project Valentine ❤️

**Project Valentine** is a prototype for a service app that allows users to send and receive online letters, prompts, and messages in a fun and meaningful way.

### ✨ Features (Initial Version)

- The website asks the recipient **"Will you be my Valentine?"** 💌
- If they say **Yes**, it reveals a personalized message, such as:
  - A scheduled date/time for an event
  - A heartfelt paragraph or letter
  - A special surprise message

This project serves as a foundation for expanding into a more interactive and customizable messaging platform.

🚀 **Work in Progress – Contributions Welcome!**
